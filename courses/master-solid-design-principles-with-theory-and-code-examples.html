                <h1>Learn SOLID Principles of OOP with a Former Amazon Engineer</h1>
                <h2>Master the 5 SOLID principles with code examples, pros and cons, and real-world examples.</h2>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</h2>
                <p>Each class should have a single responsibility, and that responsibility should be completely encapsulated by the class.</p>
                
                <h3>Live Code Example:</h3>
                <p>You will see a live code example of a class that follows the SRP, and a live code example of a class that does not follow the SRP. You will also see the pros and cons of each approach.</p> <br>
            
                <h2>Open/Closed Principle (OCP)</h2>
                <p>Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to add new functionality to your code without having to modify existing code.</p>
            
                <h3>Live Code Example:</h3>
                <p>You will see a live code example of a class that follows the OCP, and a live code example of a class that does not follow the OCP. You will also see the pros and cons of each approach.</p> <br>
            
                <h2>Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)</h2>
                <p>Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types without breaking the program. This means that you should be able to use a subtype anywhere you would use a base type, without any unexpected behavior.</p>
            
                <h3>Live Code Example:</h3>
                <p>You will see a live code example of a class that follows the LSP, and a live code example of a class that does not follow the LSP. You will also see the pros and cons of each approach.</p> <br>
            
                <h2>Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)</h2>
                <p>Interfaces should be small and specific, so that they can be easily reused and combined.</p>
            
                <h3>Live Code Example:</h3>
                <p>You will see a live code example of an interface that follows the ISP, and a live code example of an interface that does not follow the ISP. You will also see the pros and cons of each approach.</p> <br>
            
                <h2>Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)</h2>
                <p>High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. This makes your code more decoupled and easier to test and maintain.</p>
            
                <h3>Live Code Example:</h3>
                <p>You will see a live code example of a class that follows the DIP, and a live code example of a class that does not follow the DIP. You will also see the pros and cons of each approach.</p><br>
